# We wanted to address the problem of how many first, second, and even third years do not know what options of majors they have. 
# This was Bob and Valdi's first ever hackathon, and Hans, Bob, and Valdi's first time ever coding in Python.
# We made use of Pandas to read the excel data file provided and created a semi-functional program which would recommend majors 
# We did not except to finish as runner-ups to first place, as our implementation was honestly subpar compared to other teams.
# However, the hackathon organizers liked the idea we came up with, and in that perspective we did decent.
