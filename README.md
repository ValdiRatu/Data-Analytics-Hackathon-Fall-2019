# Data-Analytics-Hackathon-Fall-2019

# We wanted to address the problem of how many first, second, and even third years do not know what options of majors they have. 
# This was Bob, Furqan, and Valdi's first ever hackathon, and Hans, Bob, and Valdi's first time ever coding in Python.
# We made use of Pandas to read the excel data file provided and created a semi-functional program which would recommend majors
# We finished as runner-ups to first place, but we definitely excepted a lesser result as we did not implement any GUI, making us appear subpar compared to other teams, and also because we spent most of our time learning the basics of Python rather than implementing.
# However, the hackathon organizers liked the idea we came up with, and in that perspective we did decent.
